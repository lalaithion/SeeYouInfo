This is followed by neurophysiology with a concentration on the electrophysiology of neural systems. The basics of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology with a concentration on the electrophysiology are then applied to an examination of the structure and function of visual, auditory, and sensorimotor systems in animal and man.
